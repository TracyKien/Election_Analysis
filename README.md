# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 
I am assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee in an election audit of the tabulated results for the U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. I have been tasked with reporting the total number of votes casts, the number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
